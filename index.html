            <h2>Please help Ms. Buggy!</h2>
            <p class="text">Ms. Buggy is a poor little ladybug that needs to cross the street in safety so she can be with her family. <br><br>Unfortunately humans don't pay a lot of attention to little bugs like Ms. Buggy and they tend to step on them, that's why you need to guide her and avoid humans.
            <br><br> The more you help her the more happy she'll be, if you want to know how many times you've made her happy just look at the score!</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
         <p class="text">To play just use your keyboard arrows to control Ms. Buggy. <br><br> if she gets smashed by a human she loses a life, if she gets out of life she dies and you have to start again. <br><br> every time you get her to the other side of the street your score gets up by 1 point.</p>
