            <p class="text">Ms. Buggy is a poor little ladybug that needs to cross the street in safety so she can be with her family. <br><br> Unfortunately, humans don't pay a lot of attention to little bugs like Ms. Buggy and they tend to step on them, that's why you need to guide her and avoid humans. <br><br> The more you help her the more happy she'll be, if you want to know how many times you've made her happy just look at the score!</p>
